  Output: Welcome to the first Swirl lesson for CS350. Swirl teaches you 
      R programming interactively from your console in RStudio. To do 
      this part of the assignment, follow these steps and let us know 
      if you run into any issues. At the end of the exercise, when you 
      complete all steps, you will get a unique code that you have to 
      paste in the Google Forms link provided at the end of the exercise 
      including your name. Please note that you can use the function 
      rpt() to go back to the previous question. To end your Swirl session,
      you can type bye(). After you exit a lesson, you can always resume
      a lesson by typing swirl() again. However, make sure you use the same 
      name you always use! Press any key to continue!

- Class: text
  Output: This is your first swirl lesson. You might run into issues in the
      beginning but once you resolve them, you should be good for the rest of
      the semester. You should let us or the TA know if you run into issues
      that you cannot resolve. Press any key to continue!

- Class: text
  Output: We can relax today - instead of coding in R, this first swirl exercise will
      focus on interpreting the natural language arguments. After you proceed to the
      next step, you will see the excerpt from the preparation resource for today's 
      class. Read it carefully again - your task will be to infer the argument that is 
      made in this paragraph. Press any key to continue!

- Class: text
  Output:
      "The case for assisted suicide seems to depend on human sympathy — on the impulse 
      toward mercy, the desire to ease what seems like pointless pain and suffering. Why
      shouldn’t the terminally ill meet death on their own terms, rather than at the end 
      of prolonged agonies? Why shouldn’t the dying depart this earth with dignity,
      instead of enduring the inexorable stripping away of their physical and mental 
      faculties?"

- Class: text_question
  Output: 
      Write the argument that this paragraph makes as a set of premises and conclusions,  
      one at a time. Type your premises in the command row. While we don't have an
      auto check for your responses, please do this exercise responsibly! After you are
      done with your argument, type Next to continue! Please disregard the automatic prompts
      in this question :)
  CorrectAnswer: NULL

  Hint: When your argument is complete, type Next to continue!

- Class: text
  Output: Good job! Let's now take a look at how we interpreted the argument. Please
      note any similarities and differences with your interpretation!

- Class: text
  Output: 1. The dying person can either depart this earth with dignity or endure the
      inexorable stripping away of their physical and mental faculties.
    
- Class: text
  Output: 2. Terminally ill people should rather die on their terms than at the end of 
      prolonged agonies.
  
- Class: text
  Output: 3. Some people would prefer easing what seems like pointless pain and suffering.
  
- Class: text
  Output: 4. Therefore, assisted suicide for terminally ill is a justified form of mercy.

- Class: text_question
  Output: What fallacy does this argument rely on? 
      Please type the fallacy name **in lowercase**!
  CorrectAnswer: "straw man"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='straw man')
  Hint: Not quite! Are the claims attacked in the premises and conclusion the same?

- Class: text_question
  Output: Indeed! Preference of some group of people do make some action doesn't justify
      this action for everybody.
      Let's now have a closer look on one of the premises.
      • Terminally ill people should rather die on their terms than at the end of 
      prolonged agonies.
      Can you identify the fallacy here?
      Please type the fallacy name in lowercase!
  CorrectAnswer: "false dichotomy"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='false dichotomy')
  Hint: Not quite! Are the options presented in the claim indeed the only options 
      available?

- Class: text
  Output: Oh yes! It would be quite sad to have a binary choice like in this premise...

  Output: Congratulations! You have finished your first lesson in swirl. In the next step, 
      there will be a unique code generated for you. You should copy and paste the code 
      in the google form link that is provided to you and submit your pre-class work.
      You are responsible to correctly spell your name. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Would you like the code-generator to generate a code for you?"
